This is the code for TarzQ- an e-commerce website which helps restaurants get the required raw materials needed to prepare food. It is a cool front-end template which uses various Bootstrap features such as modals, sliders and Google Maps. 

The website contains the following sub-headings:
* Home
* About

* Contact

Also it has two additional pages for **Checkout** and **Payment** which is the preceded by a **JS Shopping Cart**, a useful tool for e-commerce websites.
